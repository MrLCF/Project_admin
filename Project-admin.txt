Building the admin suite
	PowerShell based admin scripts for Active Directory

	What are the scripts that need to be consolidated and deployed in the final tool ?
	
	1.  User unlocks
	2.  User password resets -- Generate a random password also have the facility to give a password to reset (from a list too)
	3.  Create user - From a list and singles
	4.  Create admin users (pre-programmed user base)
	5.  AD computer object clean-up (sanity check + deletion)
	6.  Service account sanity check (check enabled/disabled/managers populated/pwd expiry)
	7.  last logon checks for users - Sanity checks
	8.  Active directory service check
	9.  Server availabilty check (Pre-set and on-demand)
	10. Admin accounts check (Main groups -predefined)
	11. Check admin account sanity (enabled/disabled/managers populated/pwd expiry/last logon)
	12. Privileged account check (service accounts)
	13. Validate rules (Check if there are illegal members in important groups)
	14. Delete unwanted admin accounts (pre-defined)
	15. Delete unwanted service accounts (pre-defined)

Create a GUI for all these operations. Also, a command line.
	So, the plan would be is to create the command line first. Then move to the GUI. Maybe host on a web broser - so a web application.
	
Steps on getting these functions off the ground...
	Write the operating aspects of the script, the logging and the hints and outputs. 
	Put the checks and balances in place for ensuring no-unauthorized actions.
	Make sure un-authorized actions can be reversed with relative ease.
	Make the logging amazingly easy to read.

Then, write all the modules one by one in seperate scripts and then integrate.
